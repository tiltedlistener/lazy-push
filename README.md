# Lazy Push

Command line utility for pushing to git based on the current branch. Helps push on branches with long names which often happens when branching by issue on Jira / Bitbucket and for when you're going to to add --all / . anyways. 

Works best on branch by issue to handle rebase and other management on key branches.
